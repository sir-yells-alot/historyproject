        ARPANET was one of the first general-purpose computer networks. It was the first to establish host-to-host communication. When it was first created, it connected computers at government research sites, then universities inside the United States, but eventually became a critical piece of infrastructure for the computer science community in the USA.Commercial packet networks were first introduced in the 1970s, like Telenet. However, they were designed primarily to provide remote access to other computers, via terminals. DARPA; formerly ARPA supported initiatives for ground and satellite-based networks. The ground-based radio system would provided mobile access to the network, while satellites connected the US with several european countries. Therefore, a strong motivation existed to connect individual networks to the ARPANET so remote users could connect to their computer systems over international distances. By the end of the 1970s, a computer scientist named Vinton Cerf, solved the problem of connecting all of the computers on smaller networks to each other. He called the solution “Transmission Control Protocol”. It is very often described as, “the handshake that introduces computers to each other.”
