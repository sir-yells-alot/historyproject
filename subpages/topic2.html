        In 1991, the internet changed again. That year, a computer programmer called Tim Berners-Lee introduced the World Wide Web: an internet that was not simply a way to transfer data between point A to point B, but was a “web” of information that anyone on the internet could see. Berners-Lee created the internet as we know it.
        The same year, congress decided that the web should be used for commercial purposes as well. As a result, companies rushed to set up websites of their own, and entrepreneurs began to use the internet to sell goods directly to customers.
